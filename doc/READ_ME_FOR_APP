	Lance Wig WEB-289 Scavenger Hunt.<br>DESCRIPTION: The scavenger hunt site is an idea where users can create various scavenger hunts. Other users log onto the hunt and try to find a hidden geo-catch location in the Asheville area. Various file and classes exist for "authenticated system" which is the standard "bells and whistles" authentication class for ROR. I may or may not keep it due to the complexity involved.<br>
	There is a two main classes for hunts and members. Members can create many hunts. Members can also subscribe to other hunts.
	
	<p>Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.
